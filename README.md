Sentence audio + Sentence with Furigana.

The goal is to understand the sentence with the new grammar particle, so furigana is ok as you don't want to try and learn both grammar + kanji.

The header indicates it's grammar so you know to look for understanding. This is so you can mix then into a deck, if you wish.

The back is:
* Image
* Sentence
* Sentence translation
* Definition (I suggest mining the specific gramar point you're trying to learn). The definition is just info about the grammar point.
* The notesa re generated by ChatGPT automatically from Migaku.
