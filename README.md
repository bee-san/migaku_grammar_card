**front**

Sentence audio + Sentence with Furigana.

The goal is to understand the sentence with the new grammar particle, so furigana is ok as you don't want to try and learn both grammar + kanji.

The header indicates it's grammar so you know to look for understanding. This is so you can mix then into a deck, if you wish.

**Back**

The back is:
* Image
* Sentence
* Sentence translation
* Definition (I suggest mining the specific gramar point you're trying to learn). The definition is just info about the grammar point.
* The notesa re generated by ChatGPT automatically from Migaku.

## How to use

* https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type Follow docs to make new note type. I cloned the default Migaku one.

Here are the fields:

Click "cards" on the new note type and add the front.html to the front, back to the backa and styling to styling.

Alternatively install the .apkg file which contains 1 card with the existing note type and use that note type.
